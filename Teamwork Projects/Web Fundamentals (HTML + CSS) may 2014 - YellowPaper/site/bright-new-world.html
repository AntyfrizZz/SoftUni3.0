                            We already revealed the sinister plan of Sve Nakovsen and his gang to rule the world of education 
                            in our <a href="revolution-in-education.html">previous article</a> <em>(don’t miss to read it!)</em>.  But how exactly will he do it? Don’t be naïve - 
                            with the help of his increasing entourage of faithful students, of course.

                            He attracts our young with the promise of quality education and good jobs. What happens actually is 
                            that these young people get brainwashed, ready to obey all his orders. Hold your horses, politicians, 
                            you will find out how Nakovsen does it, just keep on reading.

                            Scientists have proven that excessive coding rearranges the links that neurons form with each other. 
                            This transformation can lead to strange behavior – adopting idols, worshiping them and following orders 
                            and commands unquestionably. Sve Nakovsen is acquainted with the study really well and uses it in a very 
                            clever way. By giving his students massive homeworks with tasks in some way connected with his personality, 
                            Sve Nakovsen gets obedient students just for one month of course training who worship him. After this first 
                            stage of brainwashing, it gets very easy for Nakovsen to convince his army in anything he wants, even in occupying 
                            all universities in Bulgaria. 
                            </p>

                            Those of the students, who fail to get into the true faith during this one month of brainwashing, 
                            participate in a special one week crash course. During this period students are forced to code day-and-night, 
                            until the strange transformation in their brains happens and they turn into one of the hardcore followers of Nakovsen.

                            Nakovsen and his gang doesn’t stop here. They are using other psychological methods for developing the spirit of a true 
                            fighter in the students. Kaka Sofka (one of our undercover agents) told us that between the lectures in SoftUni everyone 
                            stands up and starts singing patriotic songs about the university, Nakovsen, his gang and their mission. According to Bati 
                            Neycho(undercover agent #2)  all the songs  have striking resemblance to one of the most famous Soviet songs about the 
                            Second World War - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ps2jv0NpD8" target="_blank">The Sacred War</a> .

                            <p>
                            The most frightening thing is that it is too late for somebody to stop Sve Nakovsen, his gang and their students. They are 
                            slowly marching towards fulfilling their mission – taking over the world of education and building their bright new future!
