C++ 
is one of the most popular programming languages and is implemented on a wide variety of hardware 
and operating system platforms. As an efficient performance driven programming language 
it is used in systems software, application software, device drivers, embedded software, 
high-performance server and client applications, and entertainment software such as video games.

C
In computing, C is a general-purpose programming language initially developed by Dennis Ritchie between 
1969 and 1973 at AT&T Bell Labs. Like most imperative languages in the ALGOL tradition, C has facilities 
for structured programming and allows lexical variable scope and recursion, while a static type system 
prevents many unintended operations. Its design provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine 
instructions, and therefore it has found lasting use in applications that had formerly been coded in assembly 
language, most notably system software like the Unix computer operating system.

Java
Java is a computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically 
designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers 
"write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that code that runs on one platform does not need to be recompiled
to run on another. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode (class file) that can run on any 
Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture.

Python
Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes 
code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would 
be possible in languages such as C. The language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on 
both a small and large scale.
