//Implement the "Falling Rocks" game in the text console. A small dwarf stays at the bottom of the screen and can move left and right (by the arrows keys). 
//A number of rocks of different sizes and forms constantly fall down and you need to avoid a crash.
//Rocks are the symbols ^, @, *, &, +, %, $, #, !, ., ;, - distributed with appropriate density. The dwarf is (O). Ensure a constant game speed by Thread.Sleep(150).
