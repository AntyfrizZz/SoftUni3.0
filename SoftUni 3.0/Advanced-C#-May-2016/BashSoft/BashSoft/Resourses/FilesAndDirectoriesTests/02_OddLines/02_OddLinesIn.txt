Tom and Huck run away to an island.
While enjoying their new-found freedom,
they become aware that the community is
sounding the river for their bodies.
Tom sneaks back home one night to 
observe the commotion. After a brief 
moment of remorse at his loved ones' 
suffering, he is struck by the idea 
of appearing at his own funeral.
Back in school, Tom gets himself 
back in Becky's favor after he 
nobly accepts the blame for a 
book she has ripped. Soon, Muff 
Potter's trial begins, in which Tom 
testifies against Injun Joe.
