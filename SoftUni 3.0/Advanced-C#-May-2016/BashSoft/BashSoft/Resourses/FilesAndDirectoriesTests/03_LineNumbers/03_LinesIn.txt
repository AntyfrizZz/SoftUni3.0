Coffee is slightly acidic and can have a 
stimulating effect on humans because of 
its caffeine content. Coffee is one of the 
most popular drinks in the world.[3] It 
can be prepared and presented in a variety
of ways (e.g., espresso, cappuccino, 
cafe latte, etc.). It is usually served
hot, although iced coffee is also served.
Clinical studies indicate that moderate 
coffee consumption is benign or mildly 
beneficial in healthy adults, with continuing 
research on whether long-term consumption 
inhibits cognitive decline during aging or 
lowers the risk of some forms of cancer.
