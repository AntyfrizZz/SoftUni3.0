She saw a secret little clearing, and a secret little hot made of rustic poles. And she had never been here before! She realized it was the quiet place where the growing pheasants were reared; the keeper in his shirtâ€‘sleeves was kneeling, hammering. The dog trotted forward with a short, sharp bark, and the keeper lifted his face suddenly and saw her. He had a startled look in his eyes.
He straightened himself and saluted, watching her in silence, as she came forward with weakening limbs. He resented the intrusion; he cherished his solitude as his only and last freedom in life.
"I wondered what the hammering was," she said, feeling weak and breathless, and a little afraid of him, as he looked so straight at her.
"Ah'm gettin' th' coops ready for th' young bods,'" he said, in broad vernacular.
She did not know what to say, and she felt weak.
"I should like to sit down a bit," she said.
"Come and sit 'ere i' th' 'ut," he said, going in front of her to the hut, pushing aside some timber and stuff, and drawing out a rustic chair, made of hazel sticks.
"Am Ah t' light yer a little fire?" he asked, with the curious naÃ¯vetÃ© of the dialect.
"Oh, don't bother," she replied.
But he looked at her hands; they were rather blue. So he quickly took some larch twigs to the little brick fireâ€‘place in the corner, and in a moment the yellow flame was running up the chimney. He made a place by the brick hearth.
"Sit 'ere then a bit, and warm yer,'" he said.
