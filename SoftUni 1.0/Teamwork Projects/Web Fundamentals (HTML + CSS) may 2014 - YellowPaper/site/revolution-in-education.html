                            <p>Everyone, throughout Bulgaria, has heard about the Software University, 
                            his founder Sve Nakovsen and his mission to create quality education for future 
                            badass programmers.  In every interview, he explains how bad and outdated the education 
                            in the country is, promoting his idea for making a revolution in the sphere. But what are 
                            the boundaries of the revolution Nakovsen is talking about so passionately?  How can we be 
                            sure this revolution will limit to the sphere of software knowledge?
                            </p>

                            The average Bulgarian might be fooled with all these sweet talks about bright future, quality 
                            knowledge and Silicon Valley on the Balkans but our team of professional journalists is on the 
                            track of something more alarming and wicked than you might imagine. Only couple of months of investigation 
                            was enough for our undercover agents with code names kaka Sofka and bati Neycho to find out the real mission 
                            of the university.  Below are their stories:
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                            <strong>Kaka Sofka: The Software University literally wants to rule the world of education. Sve Nakovsen 
                            and his team plan to occupy all universities in Sofia</strong> thus cut all possibilities 
                            for disorientated high school graduates to have access to low quality education. This is unthinkable!!! 
                            What about our right to be dumb and become dumber?!
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                            <strong>Bati Neycho:</strong> Furthermore, they plan to exile all professors and their assistants 
                            to some of the remotest villages in Bulgaria where they will grow vegetables and fruit to feed the 
                            growing army of Softuni Students.
                            </p>

                            "After Sofia, universities in other cities will be occupied!" â€“ our agents said. The Software University 
                            and Sve Nakovsen will spread their educational hegemony throughout Bulgaria and only God knows what will come next.
